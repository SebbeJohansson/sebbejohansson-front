      The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law
      in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
      significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
      globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they
      should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws
      that protect personal information.<br><br>

      <br>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires
      that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights
      against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
      principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights
      against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or
      government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data
      processors.
